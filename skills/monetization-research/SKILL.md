# Monetization Research

## Overview

Find the monetization gaps. These are things this audience already pays for elsewhere that the channel does not offer, and open products nobody in the niche sells. The evidence is in video descriptions, offer pages and sponsor reads, which are all free to read.

## Workflow

1. Clarify scope only if needed. With no channel, audit the niche for a new entrant.
2. Read the channel's descriptions to see how it earns and who already pays it.
3. Find peers: competitors you can name, plus channels with the same audience from one or two searches using the audience filters. Drop results with a different audience.
4. Open the peers' actual offers. Note what each one is, who it is for, the price if shown, and the link. If a brand is only mentioned out loud, link the moment in the video.

## Output Format

```markdown
# 💰 Monetization Research: {channel or niche}

- **Biggest gap:** {one sentence}
- **Peers:** {n}, from {named, search}

## 🎯 Monetization Method Gaps
❌ not done yet, a gap to test · ✅ already done, with its offer linked · Money potential is an estimate.

| Method | Description | Inspiration | Money potential |
|---|---|---|---|
| ❌ {method} | {what it would be here} | [{offer}]({link}) on [{channel}]({url}), {price} | {High, Medium or Low}, {why} |

## 🧪 Open Products to Test
1. **{Specific offer}**
   - **Evidence:** {linked proof}
   - **First test:** {one sentence}
```

- Length: about 700 words. Three open products.
- Language: plain words and short, complete sentences. Nothing compressed.
- Bullets: one fact each, under 25 words, except quotes and verbatim titles. No extra sections or bullets.
- If it runs long, cut whole items. Never cut proof, and never squeeze sentences.
- Links: link every video, channel, moment, brand and offer you cite, built from IDs, handles and links in the data. Never guess one.
- Rows: cover products, courses, communities, newsletters, services, sponsors, affiliates, merch, events, software, and ads with RPM levers. Put ❌ rows first, highest potential on top, and ✅ rows last.
- Sponsors: the sponsors row links brands seen on peers, not the channel's current sponsors.

## Common Pitfalls

- Do not search without `publishedAtFrom` and `classificationQuality` at `"neutral"` or above, or the results fill with low-effort videos.
- Do not call every mention a sponsor. Some are affiliate links or the creator's own products.
- Do not rank a method high when this channel already runs it well.
- Do not copy a method without the trust behind it. A 2K channel cannot run a 500K channel's course funnel.
