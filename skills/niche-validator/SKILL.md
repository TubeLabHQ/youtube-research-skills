# Niche Validator

## Overview

One niche, one verdict: enter, enter with a twist, or stay out. It uses the same three scores as TubeLab's Niche Analyzer, so it matches the app. Beyond the scores, the question is whether new channels are breaking in.

## Workflow

1. Clarify scope only if needed. Name the niche in 2 to 3 words; if given a channel, take it from its titles. Start with the last 3 months, and widen to 6 months, then a year, if results are thin. Say so.
2. Sample as the app does: search videos for the niche from two angles, sorted by views with no ratio floor, so leaders show up. Take the first 10 to 15 on-topic channels behind the top results; a channel is on-topic when most of its recent titles serve the niche's audience. Skip channels under 1,000 subscribers and videos with paid-looking views. Read each for its most-viewed video as returned, average views and subscribers. Add a known leader only if the searches missed it.
3. Run one channel search for young channels (joined in the last year, above 1K median views). It feeds Breaking In only. About three searches in all. Fetch and view the thumbnail of every video you feature, and say so if one fails to load.
4. Compute three scores from the sampled channels. Leave out, and name, any channel whose views per subscriber exceed three times the sample's median. Do not leave a channel out because it is big. If a read and a search hit disagree, trust the read. Round each score, cap it at 100, then band it.
   - Market Size: average each channel's most-viewed video, divide by 1,000,000, and multiply by 100.
   - Unsaturated: for each channel, divide average views by subscribers. Average those ratios, divide by 1.1, and multiply by 100.
   - Profitable: average the low RPM estimates from the search hits' channel data, divide by 7 dollars, and multiply by 100. If RPM is missing, say it could not be computed.
   - Bands: under 50 is weak 🔴, 50 to 70 is fair 🟡, and 71 or more is strong 🟢.
5. Name the formats behind the winners, by ratio on the same hits, what the leaders never cover, and two or three ideas that bend it, such as joining two proven formats.

## Output Format

```markdown
# ⚖️ Niche Verdict: {niche}

- **Verdict:** {enter, enter with a twist, or stay out}, {why, with numbers}
- **Sample:** {n} on-topic channels, {n} outliers, {window, and whether it was widened}
- **Left out of the scores:** {channels, and why; drop this bullet if none}

| Score | 0 to 100 | Band | Based on |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Market Size | {n} | {🟢, 🟡 or 🔴} | viral views potential {n}, average views {n}, {"set by one video" if the band changes without it} |
| Unsaturated | {n} | {band} | reach beyond subscribers {ratio} |
| Profitable | {n} | {band} | RPM {band}, from {n} channels |

Revenue estimate, unreliable outside English-speaking audiences:

| Views | 1K | 10K | 100K | 1M |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Revenue | {band} | {band} | {band} | {band} |

## 🚀 Breaking In
- [{channel}]({url}) · {age, subscribers, median views}

## ✅ Formats That Work

### 1. {Format}

[![]({thumbnail})]({video url})

- [{channel}]({url}) · [{title}]({video url}) · {views, ratio, date}
- [{channel}]({url}) · [{title}]({video url}) · {views, ratio, date}
- [{channel}]({url}) · [{title}]({video url}) · {views, ratio, date}

## 🎯 Gaps and Ideas
- **Leaders never cover:** {one sentence}
- **{Idea}:** {one sentence}

## 🌍 Other Languages
{Check French, German and Spanish markets only if the user asked or the niche looks saturated, since each costs more searches: market, channels found, open or not. Otherwise leave this section out.}

## 🧭 Entry Plan
- **Angle:** {the gap and the format, in one sentence}
- **First titles:** {three titles}
```

- Length: about 700 words. Three items per section.
- Language: plain words and short, complete sentences. Nothing compressed.
- Bullets: one fact each, under 25 words, except quotes and verbatim titles. No extra sections or bullets.
- If it runs long, cut whole items. Never cut proof, and never squeeze sentences.
- Links: link every video, channel, moment, brand and offer you cite, built from IDs, handles and links in the data. Never guess one.
- Thumbnails: use the 320px `mqdefault.jpg` image, on its own line under the heading, linked to the video.

## Common Pitfalls

- Do not search without `publishedAtFrom` and `classificationQuality` at `"neutral"` or above, or the results fill with low-effort videos.
- Do not present the scores as measurements. They are estimates from a sample, and RPM is unreliable outside English-speaking audiences.
- Do not call a niche open on big views. Ten established channels and no newcomer above 1K median views means it is closed.
- Do not count huge views with almost no likes as demand; they are usually paid.
- Do not name a format from fewer than 3 outliers on different channels. The language tag can call a Hindi or Urdu video English, so check the title and thumbnail.
- Do not judge fewer than 10 on-topic channels. Say what would settle it.
